# Level 1: Basic websocket server and client implementation

## Setting up
Change to this directory:  
`cd node-ws-demo/level-1`  

Install the required node modules:  
`npm install`  
Note: The only library required here is `ws`  

## Run the server
You should open two terminals, one for the server and one for the client. To test multiple clients connecting and disconnecting open a new terminal for each client.  

In the server terminal simply run:  
`node server.js`  

You should see the following:  
`Server started at port: XXXX`  

## Connect the client
